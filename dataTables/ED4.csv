element	title	description
animate	An element for changing the value of a specified attribute over a given time period.	The animate element is put inside a shape element and defines how an attribute of an element changes over the animation. The attribute will change from the initial value to the end value in the duration specified.
animateMotion	An element used to move a shape along a path	The animateMotion element causes a referenced element to move along a motion path.
animateTransform	An element used to scale, rotate, translate and skew a shape over time	The animateTransform element animates a transformation attribute on a target element, thereby allowing animations to control translation, scaling, rotation and/or skewing.
mpath	An elementt used to specify path for animateMotion	the mpath sub-element for the <animatemotion> element provides the ability to reference an external <path> element as the definition of a motion path.
set	An element used to sets an attribute value at a given time	The set element provides a simple means of just setting the value of an attribute for a specified duration. It supports all attribute types, including those that cannot reasonably be interpolated, such as string and boolean values. The set element is non-additive. The additive and accumulate attributes are not allowed, and will be ignored if specified.
animateColor	An elementt used to specify a color transformation over time	Element used to specify a color transformation over time. The use of 'animateColor' is deprecated, since all of its functionality can be achieved simply by using 'animate' to target properties that can take color values. The 'animateColor' element may be dropped from a future version of the SVG specification.

marker	An element to create a marker arrowheads, tails, ...	The marker element defines the graphics that is to be used for drawing arrowheads or polymarkers on a given <path>, <line>, <polyline> or <polygon> element.
mask	An element used to do masking	In SVG, you can specify that any other graphics object or <g> element can be used as an alpha mask for compositing the current object into the background. A mask is defined with the mask element. A mask is used/referenced using the mask property.
pattern	An element to create a specified pattern (used as fill),	"A pattern is used to fill or stroke an object using a pre-defined graphic object which can be replicated (""tiled""), at fixed intervals in x and y to cover the areas to be painted. Patterns are defined using the pattern element and then referenced by properties fill and stroke on a given graphics element to indicate that the given element shall be filled or stroked with the referenced pattern."
switch	An element used as a switch description=	The switch element evaluates the requiredFeatures, requiredExtensions and systemLanguage attributes on its direct child elements in order, and then processes and renders the first child for which these attributes evaluate to true. All others will be bypassed and therefore not rendered. If the child element is a container element such as a <g>, then the entire subtree is either processed/rendered or bypassed/not rendered.
defs	An element used to contain definitions	SVG allows graphical objects to be defined for later reuse. It is recommended that, wherever possible, referenced elements be defined inside of a defs element. Defining these elements inside of a defs element promotes understandability of the SVG content and thus promotes accessibility. Graphical elements defined in a defs will not be directly rendered. You can use a <use> element to render those elements wherever you want on the viewport.
symbol	An element used to contain but not render directly a graphical object	A place to define a graphical object for later use by referencing it.
desc	An element to contain a description	Each container element or graphics element in an SVG drawing can supply a desc description string where the description is text-only. When the current SVG document fragment is rendered as SVG on visual media, desc elements are not rendered as part of the graphics. Alternate presentations are possible, both visual and aural, which display the desc element but do not display path elements or other graphics elements. The desc element generally improve accessibility of SVG documents
metadata	An element that contains metadata	Metadata is structured data about data. Metadata which is included with SVG content should be specified within metadata elements. The contents of the metadata should be elements from other XML namespaces such as RDF, FOAF, etc.
title	An elementt which  holds the title	Each container element or graphics element in an SVG drawing can supply a title description string where the description is text-only. When the current SVG document fragment is rendered as SVG on visual media, title element is not rendered as part of the graphics. However, some user agents may, for example, display the title element as a tooltip. Alternate presentations are possible, both visual and aural, which display the title element but do not display path elements or other graphics elements. The title element generally improve accessibility of SVG documents
feBlend	A filter primitive element used for blending	The feBlend filter composes two objects together ruled by a certain blending mode. This is similar to what is known from image editing software when blending two layers. The mode is defined by the mode attribute.

The resulting image is an RGBA image based on the light color. The lighting calculation follows the standard specular component of the Phong lighting model. The resulting image depends on the light color, light position and surface geometry of the input bump map. The result of the lighting calculation is added. The filter primitive assumes that the viewer is at infinity in the z direction.

The effect is the same as if the nodes were deeply cloned into a non-exposed DOM, and then pasted where the use element is, much like anonymous content and XBL. Since the cloned nodes are not exposed, care must be taken when using CSS to style a use element and its hidden descendants. CSS attributes are not guaranteed to be inherited by the hidden, cloned DOM unless you explicitly request it using CSS inheritance.

To specify that a block of text is to be rendered along the shape of a <path>, include the given text within a textPath element which includes an xlink:href attribute with a reference to a <path> element.
tref	An element used to provide a reference to text content data	The textual content for a <text> can be either character data directly embedded within the <text> element or the character data content of a referenced element, where the referencing is specified with a tref element.

cursor	An element used to define platform-independent custom cursor	The cursor element can be used to define a platform-independent custom cursor. A recommended approach for defining a platform-independent custom cursor is to create a PNG image and define a cursor element that references the PNG image and identifies the exact position within the image which is the pointer position (i.e., the hot spot),.
